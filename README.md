# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird is a simple yet notoriously challenging mobile arcade game that became a viral sensation. Players control a small bird that flaps its wings to stay airborne and navigate through a series of green pipe obstacles. The objective is to tap the screen to keep the bird flying and avoid crashing into the pipes or the ground.
